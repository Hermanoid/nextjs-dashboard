 ERR_PNPM_UNEXPECTED_VIRTUAL_STORE  Unexpected virtual store location

The dependencies at "C:\Source\nextjs-dashboard\node_modules" are currently symlinked from the virtual store directory at "C:\Source\nextjs_tutorial\nextjs-dashboard\node_modules\.pnpm".

pnpm now wants to use the virtual store at "C:\Source\nextjs-dashboard\node_modules\.pnpm" to link dependencies from the store.

If you want to use the new virtual store location, reinstall your dependencies with "pnpm install".

You may change the virtual store location by changing the value of the virtual-store-dir config.
